# openvpn_ui

Simple web UI to manage OpenVPN users, their certificates & routes in Linux. While backend is written in Go, frontend is based on Vue.js. This project is based on [palark/ovpn-admin](https://github.com/palark/ovpn-admin) and adapted for this repository.

Originally created in Flant for internal needs & used for years, then updated to be more modern and publicly released in March'21. Your contributions are welcome!

***DISCLAIMER!** This project was created for experienced users (system administrators) and private (e.g., protected by network policies) environments only. Thus, it is not implemented with security in mind (e.g., it doesn't strictly check all parameters passed by users, etc.). It also relies heavily on files and fails if required files aren't available.*

## Features

* Adding, deleting OpenVPN users (generating certificates for them);
* Revoking/restoring/rotating users certificates;
* Generating ready-to-user config files;
* Providing metrics for Prometheus, including certificates expiration date, number of (connected/total) users, information about connected users;
* (optionally) Specifying CCD (`client-config-dir`) for each user;
* (optionally) Operating in a master/slave mode (syncing certs & CCD with other server);
* (optionally) Specifying/changing password for additional authorization in OpenVPN;
* (optionally) Specifying the Kubernetes LoadBalancer if it's used in front of the OpenVPN server (to get an automatically defined `remote` in the `client.conf.tpl` template).
* (optionally) Storing certificates and other files in Kubernetes Secrets (**Attention, this feature is experimental!**).

## Prerequisites

You need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

## Installation

There is a ready-to-use docker-compose config, so you can just change/add values you need and start it with `start_openvpn.sh`.

You can create it from copying example file:

    cp docker-compose.yaml.example docker-compose.yaml

Then find and replace all following variables in docker-compose.yaml:

* `YOUR_OPENVPN_SERVER_IP`: Public IP address of your OpenVPN server
* `YOUR_OPENVPN_SERVER_PORT`: Port of your OpenVPN server (you can set 1194 as default)
* `YOUR_OVPN_ADMIN_USER`: Login to access ovpn-admin via HTTP basic authentication
* `YOUR_OVPN_ADMIN_PORT`: Port to access ovpn-admin (you can set 80 as default)
* `YOUR_OVPN_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`: Hash in apr1 for your admin password

The first settings are quite easy to fill, but getting `YOUR_OVPN_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` could be a bit complicated/ You need to choose a password and create an `apr1` hash for it. You can do it via command

    openssl passwd -apr1 YOUR_PASSWORD

Then you'll get string like that: `$apr1$fvM4f1vt$kQoXBas63UsUEJt4MaItS1`.

Please double all `$` signs to avoid variable rendering in docker-compose file, so, finally you'll have something like that: `$$apr1$$fvM4f1vt$$kQoXBas63UsUEJt4MaItS1`

Commands to execute:

Please note that you can skip running `setup_firewall.sh` if you manually configure your network.

```bash
git clone <this-repo-url>
cd openvpn_ui
chmod +x setup_firewall.sh
chmod +x start_openvpn.sh
OVPN_SERVER_PORT=YOUR_OPENVPN_SERVER_PORT ./setup_firewall.sh
./start_openvpn.sh
```

## Notes
* this tool uses external calls for `bash`, `coreutils` and `easy-rsa`, thus **Linux systems only are supported** at the moment.
* to enable additional password authentication provide `--auth` and `--auth.db="/etc/easyrsa/pki/users.db`" flags and install [openvpn-user](https://github.com/pashcovich/openvpn-user/releases/latest). This tool should be available in your `$PATH` and its binary should be executable (`+x`).
* master-replica synchronization does not work with `--storage.backend=kubernetes.secrets` - **WIP**
* additional password authentication does not work with `--storage.backend=kubernetes.secrets` -  **WIP**
* if you use `--ccd` and `--ccd.path="/etc/openvpn/ccd"` abd plan to use static address setup for users do not forget to provide `--ovpn.network="172.16.100.0/24"` with valid openvpn-server network 
* tested only with Openvpn-server versions 2.4 and 2.5 with only tls-auth mode
* not tested with EasyRsa version > 3.0.8
* status of users connections update every 28 second(*no need to ask why =)*)
